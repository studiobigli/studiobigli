<h1 align="center">Hey all, I'm Liam</h1>

Having recently left a twenty year career in retail, I have spent the last year refining a lifetime's worth of computer knowledge and skills in aid of transitioning into a career in IT.  

I have completed a Data Engineering bootcamp with [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com/) which has taught me the fundamentals of Python, postgreSQL, Terraform and AWS Cloud infrastructure. It also gave me the chance to work with Agile practices, with our group project having scrum meetings daily, planning and delegating our work tasks with a Kanban board. This has given me the confidence to further my understanding of other programming languages.

I am learning more advanced uses of Python, as well as taking my understanding of this and using it to learn the fundamentals of Go, Rust and Lua with the intent of contributing towards bug fixes and features of daily-driver Linux applications, and self-hosted alternatives to commonly used modern cloud applications.

<h3>Projects</h3>

- [TerrificTotes Data Platform Project](https://github.com/studiobigli/northcoders-project) - end of bootcamp group project to develop an Extract -> Transform -> Load (ETL) pipeline with AWS Cloud infrastructure. Coded in Python, with use of the pg8000 library to communicate with postgreSQL databases, deployed to AWS using Terraform and GitHub Actions. Resulting data transformed into human readable data using seaborn, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook and Tableau.

- [GDPR Obfuscator Project](https://github.com/studiobigli/gdpr-project) - post bootcamp solo project to develop a Python library capable of taking a byte stream of CSV with a list of column names, obfuscating the data in those columns and returning the resulting obfuscated data as a byte stream suitable for an end user script to write to a file. Contains examples using it locally with bash scripts and in an AWS environment, as well as a Python script that generates example data using the Faker library.
