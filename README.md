<h1 align="center">Hey all, I'm Liam</h1>

Having recently left a twenty year career in retail, I have spent the last year refining a lifetime's worth of computer knowledge and skills in aid of transitioning into a career in IT. 

I have completed a Data Engineering bootcamp with [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com/) which has taught me the fundamentals of Python, postgreSQL, Terraform and AWS Cloud infrastructure. This has given me the confidence to further my understanding of other programming languages.

I am currently learning fundamentals of Javascript, Go, Rust and Lua with the intent of contributing towards bug fixes and features of daily-driver Linux applications, and self-hosted alternatives to commonly used modern cloud applications.

<h3>Projects</h3>

- [TerrificTotes Data Platform Project](https://github.com/studiobigli/northcoders-project) - end of bootcamp group project to develop an Extract -> Transform -> Load (ETL) pipeline with AWS Cloud infrastructure. Coded in Python, with use of the pg8000 library to communicate with postgreSQL databases, deployed to AWS using Terraform and GitHub Actions. Resulting data transformed into human readable data using seaborn, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook and Tableau.

- [GDPR Obfuscator Project](https://github.com/studiobigli/gdpr-project) - post-bootcamp solo project to develop a Python library capable of taking source CSV files with a list of column names, obfuscating the data in those columns and writing the resulting ofuscated data to a new CSV file. Contains examples using it locally with bash scripts and in an AWS environment, as well as a Python script that generates example data using the Faker library.
